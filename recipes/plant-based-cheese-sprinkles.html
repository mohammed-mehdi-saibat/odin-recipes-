    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These plant-based cheese sprinkles come about because lately I've started experimenting with
        <p>more plant-based food, and the most difficult part for me is giving up cheese. Most</p>
        <p>plant-based cheese is heavily processed, so I concocted these cheese like sprinkles,</p>
        <p>which surprisingly work to cure my craving!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup cashews</li>
        <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place cashews in a food processor. Pulse until tiny crumbs form. Remove the </p>
            <p>lid and add the nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt.</p>
            <p>Pulse just a few more times until combined, and mixture has a crumb</p>
            <p>texture but is not yet a powder.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
