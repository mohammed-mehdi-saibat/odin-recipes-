    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h4>Ahead Of Time</h4>
        <li>
            <p>
                Making and shredding msemen is best done ahead of time. Tear the msemen into bite-size pieces while hot off the griddle. 
                <p>
                When cool, store in a plastic bag. If prepared more than a day in advance, freeze the shredded msemen until needed.
                </p>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The night before (or at least six hours before cooking), soak the fenugreek seeds and lentils in separate bowls of</p>
            <p>cold water.(if you forget to fo this, you can do a quick soak by pouring boiling water over the fenugreek and</p>
            <p>letting them sit an hour or two.)Drain when ready to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The night before (or at least six hours before cooking), mix the chicken with the onions, olive oil, salt, pepper,</p>
            <p>ginger, turmeric, saffron and Ras el Hanout spices in a heavy-bottomed pot. Stir to coat the chicken well, cover,</p>
            <p>and leave in the fridge to marinate.</p>
        </li>
        <h4>Cook the chicken and Lentils</h4>
        <li>
            <p>Place the pot with the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook, covered, stirring accasionally, for about</p>
            <p>15 to 20 minutes, until a rich sauce has formed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><h4>If Using a free range (beldi) chicken:</h4> Add the drained fenugreek seeds, parsley, cilantro and the water.</p>
            <p>Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for about 1 hour. Add the drained lentils and continue cooking,</p>
            <p>covered, for another hour, or until the chicken and lentils are quite tender. Add water as needed during</p>
            <p>cooking to ensure that ample broth remains in the pot, and correct seasoning if necessary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><h4>If using a regular, factory-raised (roumi) chicken:</h4> Add the drained lentils, drained fenugreek seeds,</p>
            <p>parsley, cilantro and the water. Simmer, covered, over medium-low to medium heat for about 1 hour, or until</p>
            <p>the lentils are tender and the chicken is well-cooked. There should be rich, ample broth in the pot. (If</p>
            <p>there's not, add a little water during cooking, tasting to be sure that the seasoning is not diluted.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Taste the broth for salt, then add the smen, swirling the pot to incorporate it into the broth. If desired,</p>
            <p>remove the chicken from the pot and place it under a broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.</p>
        </li>
        <h4>Serve the Chicken Rfisa</h4>
        <li>
            <p>Steam the shredded msemen in a couscoussier for about 10 minutes, or until steaming hot and tender. Spread</p>
            <p>or mound the hot, shredded msemen on a large serving dish. Add the chicken to the bed of msemen, and  </p>
            <p>distribute the lentils, onions and most of the broth over all. Reserve a bowlful or two of broth to</p>
            <p>offer on the side. (<i>If you tied the fenugreek in cheesecloth, empty it into a bowl to offer on </i></p>
            <p><i>the side as well.)</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Rfisa is traditionally enjoyed communally from the serving dish, with each person eating from his</p>
            <p>own side of the plate by hand or with a spoon.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
