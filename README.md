First Odin Project Project
ODIN RECIPES
This project is ODIN RECIPES, a basic recipes website. It aims to practice all of the HTML knowledge acquired. Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

 -Setting up a GitHub repository
 -Writing good commit messages
 -Working with Git
 -Writing HTML code
 -Pushing my work to GitHub to see my project on the web

At the end of the project, I will revisit this section to reflect on what I have learned and how I have applied these skills.
